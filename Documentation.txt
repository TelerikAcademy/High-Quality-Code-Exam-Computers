Design pattern: Simple Factory
	* In Program class, method CreateComputers is simple factory creating different type of IComputersFactory based on user input

Design pattern: Strategy
	* 

Design pattern: Template Method
	* Cpu has method SquareNumber which uses the abstract method GetMaxValue which is implemented in Cpu32, Cpu64 and Cpu128

Design pattern: Abstract factory
	* Introduced IComputersFactory as a base class for HpComputersFactory and DellComputersFactory which creates different type of computers

Design pattern: Composite
	* 

Design pattern: Mediator
